mbball is an American Football results picking competition Manager.
Used on Melinda's Backups (http://www.melindasbackups.com) for their
annual competition during the American Football season, this software
provides two parts.

An administrator can manage the competition, defining the matches and
their cut-off times for picking results and then subsequently entering
the match results.

Players sign on to the football (using the their community forum login
- currently uses SMF)

The software now uses an SQLite database to hold all the results.
