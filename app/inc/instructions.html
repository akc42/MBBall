<h3>General Points</h3>
<p>Comment areas are small boxes about 20 characters wide by six lines deep designed for <i>short</i> comments about your pick</p>
<p>You can enhance these with the chat emoticons (with focus in a comment box click on the icon from the list above, or just enter the code directly). It also accepts
[b] and [s] codes (for <b>bold</b> and <s>strikeout</s>) in a similar way to the main forum.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> All times are the <b>local time</b> as set in your computer.</p>

<p>Match picks are provided in a list of matches, listed vertically.  Each match has 3/4 columns (dependent on whether
the administrator has defined this to be an round to select over under
<ul>
<li>Match Column - a small table in its own right with the following
	<ul>
	<li>The two teams - in the blue of a table header</li>
	<li>The match time - in the blue of the table header</li>
	<li>Two radio buttons, corresponding to the two teams to make your pick. If one of the teams is regarded as the underdog for which an additional 
	    points will be awarded when you pick them then you will see a small marker like this <span style="font-size:0.8em;background-color:#97FFC3;">2</span> showing how
	    many additional points are available</li>
	<li>The pick deadline - generally the same for each competition - defaults to an hour before.  This turns red when less than a day to go.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>The Over/Under selection (only for some rounds - as defined by the administrator)
	<ul>
	<li>The number for comparing with the combined score from the match</li>
	<li>Labels "Over" and "Under"</li>
	<li>Radio Buttons to make your selection</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Possible comment from the administrator</li>
<li>An area for you to enter your match comment.  Use the facilities described in <i>General Comments</i> above to add bold, strickout or emoticons to your text</li>
</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
<p>Bonus questions are optionally set for a round by the competition administrator.  You will see the question on the left of this section.  The administrator
can choose from</p>
<ul>
<li>Multichoice question - in which case you can select the answer via a radio button, or</li>
<li> A question that requires a single (whole number) answer from you</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to a non multichoice bonus question will be validated to be a valid whole number - so must not contain alphabetic or punctuation characters.  If it does you will get a
<span class="error">pink background like this</span> and although your picks will be accepted, the answer will not.  You will also be informed
via an error message in the comment field.</p>
<p>As with the main team picks, you can also add any comment you wish to this answer in the comment area</p>
</td>
			<td>
<p>Playoff picks are made in the area below the two other types of pick.  These apply across the complete competition, not to any specific round.
Against each team are three radio buttons, linked to other radio buttons of the same category.  These are
<ul>
<li>Divisional winner</li>
<li>First wildcard pick for a conference</li>
<li>Second wildcard pick for a conference</li>
</ul>
Like all radio buttons, selecting a new team, unselect the previous team in that category.  There is an additional facility, in that if you try to select
a radio button in one category and the team is already selected in another, you will be prevented.  The radio button in the other category is briefly highlighted
if you do this, and the radio button is then returned to where it was</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>A team selected by any means that makes the playoffs will get points (the number of points default to 1, but if additional points are to be awarded then the value is show with a small
marker like this <span style="font-size:0.8em;background-color:#97FFC3;">2</span>.  So if you selected a team to be divisional winner, and it makes the
playoff via a wildcard position you will still get the points (although, of course, it normally means you wildcard pick was wrong - unless that predicted the divisional winner!</p>

<h3>Recording the picks with the server</h3>
<p>Once you have made your picks, you must register them with the server.  Hit that "Make your picks" button at the bottom right of this section and
the whole area below your main menu should collapse into a small white rectangle with a spinning wheel in the middle to show the server is busy, and when it has
added your picks to everyone elses, will redisplay the page with your picks included.<p>

<p>You can adjust your picks at any time up to the deadline.  <b>NOTE:</b> calling up the page again will mean that after a particular match deadline has passed that match will disappear. 
Even if you leave your page open, so it is not refreshed - any attempt to make a pick after the deadline will be ignored.</p>
<p>In special circumstances the Administrator can make picks on your behalf even after the deadline.  In fairness to other players picks set this way will have a small marker against them should they have been added late.</p>
