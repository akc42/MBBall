NOTES _ THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY A TIDDLY WIKI

 This is just some random comments on the design and implementation as I come to them so that they are noted for the future.

PAGE LAYOUT

index.php

Menu - enables other competitions and rounds to be viewed ($cid and $rid hold competition and round id)

If user is registered then
	Match pick Selection
	if playoffs selection in play
		Playoff selection (divisional winner and 2 wildcards for each conference)
	

Show all users picks for this round, together with comments and bonus question answers - plus total scores for round

Show all users and then summary of points for each round so far, together with final total.

register.php  - allows user to register himself for a competition

admin.php - admin (to be expanded)

This autoloads one of two parts 

competitions.php (a list of competitions + ability to create a new competition)
competition.php (the detail of a competition + autoload of either rounds.php or round.php)

rounds.php - list of rounds in competition + ability to create new round
round.php (detail of round + autoload of matches.php)

matches.php (allows editing the details of matches from list of teams)



DATES AND TIMES

Dates and times (of matches mainly) need to be displayed in the local time of the user.  This is only known at the javascript level and not php.  In order to manage this - all times will be held in seconds since 1970 (unix time) and converted to local time via javaascript.  All time to be output as

<span class="time">12345678</span> or <input class="time type="text" value="12345678" />

where 12345678 is the actual value of the date required in unix time.

The init function of javascript will look for all span like this and
convert to a local time display. In terms of coming the otherway,
javascript will need to intercept the input and parse it using the
Date.parse() function.  Due to a bug in the Firefox timezone display,
which means it outputs the correct time but the wrong value of GMT or
BST (don't know about other timezones) the parsing the otherway does
not work unless the last 4 characters of the time and date are left
off.

EMOTICONS

Created a new class Emoticon

var myEmoticons = new MBB.Emoticon(container, outputDivs);

where 
      container holds the emoticon list (preprepared via php during
      page load)

      - outputDivs is an array of elements or a single element into
which the clicked emoticon will be placed.  The focus of each of these
divis is tracked so that when the user clicks on an icon in container,
the key is output into one of these divs.

The remainder of the formating is done in php (dbBBCode is updated
with the same key and <img/> strings as container so on output they
are output too)
