 This is just some random comments on the design and implementation as I come to them so that they are noted for the future.

DATES AND TIMES

Dates and times (of matches mainly) need to be displayed in the local time of the user.  This is only known at the javascript level and not php.  In order to manage this - all times will be held in seconds since 1970 (unix time) and converted to local time via javaascript.  All time to be output as

<span class="time">12345678</span>

where 12345678 is the actual value of the date required in unix time.

The init function of javascript will look for all span elements like this and convert to a local time display.
